Welcome to Quetzal OpenAPI client's documentation!
==================================================

.. warning:: The documentation of this package is not entirely compatible
   with Sphinx.

This is an auto-generated package, with documentation written in markdown. Due
to an incompatibility on the links of markdown, none of the markdown files are
included in this site. However, they are available from the github repository,
with working links.

The purpose of this documentation is to provide a Sphinx RTD site for the models
used in the ``quetzal.autogen`` package so that other packages can reference it.
